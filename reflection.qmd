## GenAI I used
I used ChatGPT to help me polish writing, fix formatting in Quarto, and troubleshoot GitHub Pages deployment.

## How it helped 
- Helping me mostly in organising and improving my content into a clean web page structure (headings, lists, links)
- Fixing YAML indentation issues and navbar setup
- Assisting me when my images were not showing properly 

## What’s beneficial
- Faster drafting and reformatting
- Helpful for debugging 
- Gives examples that I can adapt

## What’s challenging
- Sometimes I still need to verify steps in my own setup (RStudio/Git settings differ)
- I still need to decide what is truthful and relevant

## How I might use GenAI in future
For writing first drafts, cleaning documentation, brainstorming, and debugging.
I believe GenAI will be useful in both my studies and future work, especially in areas such as documentation, data analysis explanations, and technical problem solving.


## Final thoughts
Overall, GenAI supported my learning process instead of replacing it. It helped me work more efficiently, understand technical concepts better, and reflect more deeply on my own work.
